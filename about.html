        <h1>About</h1>
        <hr class="section-rule">

        <p>I'm Richard Cruz — a strategic consultant, educator, and systems thinker based in the Philippines. I work with organizations navigating complex transformations: governance redesign, business model shifts, capability building, and institutional renewal.</p>

        <p>For over 25 years, I served on the faculty of the Asian Institute of Management, where I led the School of Executive Education and Lifelong Learning. That experience — operating at the intersection of academic rigor and business reality — shaped how I think about institutional change: not as a project to be managed, but as a system to be designed.</p>

        <p>Today, through Shift Consulting, I help leadership teams move from operational competence to genuine strategic capability. My work draws on systems thinking, complexity science, governance design, and transformative learning theory.</p>

        <p>This site is where I think out loud — about the patterns I see, the frameworks I develop, and the questions that don't have clean answers.</p>

        <h2>Get in touch</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to discuss ideas, explore a collaboration, or challenge something I've written, I'd welcome the conversation. Reach me at <a href="mailto:richard@profcruz.com">richard@profcruz.com</a>.</p>
